    <h2><a name="GNUMAKE">GNUMAKE backend for qmake</a></h2>

    <p>The GNUMAKE backend generates makefiles for the GNU Make utility from
    <kbd>qmake</kbd>'s project files. A separate generator became necessary
    because the previously used MINGW generator has some problems and
    limitations that make it impossible to generate correct makefiles in
    several situations. This new generator is primarily intended to be used
    with GNU Make under OS/2, but theoretically can be used on any platform
    after some modifications. However, its usage under other platforms is not
    tested and not supported.</p>

    <p>The GNUMAKE backend was initially based on the existing MINGW backend,
    so here is the list of its differences and improvements comparing to the
    MINGW backend:</p>

    <p>1. <code>QMAKE_LINK_OBJECT_MAX</code>,
    <code>QMAKE_LINK_OBJECT_SCRIPT</code>,
    <code>QMAKE_LINK_OBJMOC_SCRIPT</code> are no longer supported, since the
    OS/2 version of GNU <kbd>LD</kbd> (linker) seems not to support object
    link scripts. The OS/2 CMD.EXE command line length limitation (1024 chars)
    is worked around in a different way (see the
    <kbd>\mkspecs\os2-g++\qmake.conf</kbd> if interested).</p>

    <p>2. Added new qmake varibales <code>QMAKE_RUN_LINK</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_RUN_LIB</code> (intended to be used in qmake.conf) to
    explicitly specify the command to execute the linker and the librarian,
    respectively. These variables are optional and have the following
    defaults:</p>

    <pre>$(LINK) $(LFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(DEF_FILE) $(OBJECTS) $(OBJMOC) $(LIBS)
$(LIB) $(TARGET) $(OBJECTS) $(OBJMOC)</pre>

    <p>3. <code>QMAKE_EXTRA_WIN_COMPILERS</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_EXTRA_WIN_TARGETS</code> are renamed to
    <code>QMAKE_EXTRA_COMPILERS</code> and <code>QMAKE_EXTRA_TARGETS</code>
    respectively, for clarity.</p>

    <p>4. Leaving <code>QMAKE_LIBS_QT_ENTRY</code> empty does not produce a
    qmake warning any more.</p>

    <p>5. Added the new qmake variable <code>QMAKE_RUN_IMPLIB</code> used to
    produce the import library when the target is the dynamic link library. It
    is expected that this variable specifies the output import library name
    with the <code>$(TARGET_IMPLIB)</code> macro, which is defined by qmake as
    the project's target dll full basename with the <kbd>.lib</kbd>
    extension.</p>

    <p>6. Added new qmake variables <code>QMAKE_RUN_GENDEF</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_GENDEF_DEPS</code>. They are intended to generate a
    <kbd>.def</kbd> file containing a list of DLL exports when the target is
    the dynamic link library (i.e. when <code>TEMPLATE&nbsp;= lib</code> and
    <code>CONFIG</code> contains <code>dll</code>) and the
    <code>DEF_FILE</code> variable is empty or not specified in the project
    file. In this case, the <code>DEF_FILE</code> macro is defined by qmake as
    the project's target full basename with the .def extension.
    <code>QMAKE_RUN_GENDEF</code> is the command to generate this
    <code>DEF_FILE</code> (its output must go to <code>$(DEF_FILE)</code>).
    <code>QMAKE_GENDEF_DEPS</code> is the list of dependencies for the
    <code>DEF_FILE</code>.</p>

    <p>7. Empty <code>OBJECTS_DIR</code> and <code>MOC_DIR</code> qmake
    variables do not cause GNU Make to print warnings any more.</p>

    <p>8. Fixed the <kbd>dist</kbd> makefile target: the generated zip didn't
    have the name (only extension).</p>

    <p>9. Commands for custom (user defined) targets and for extra compilers
    (i.e. values of <code>&lt;my_target&gt;.commands</code> variables) are now
    splitted at '<kbd>&nbsp;;;&nbsp;</kbd>' sequences (a double semicolon
    surrounded by single spaces) and placed to separate lines in the makefile.
    For example, the definition
    '<code>&lt;my_target&gt;.command&nbsp;=&nbsp;c1&nbsp;;;&nbsp;c2</code>'
    will apperar as follows:</p>

    <pre>&lt;my_target&gt;: &lt;my_target_deps&gt;
    c1
    c2</pre>

    <p>10. Added new qmake variables <code>QMAKE_QUIET_CLEAN</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_IF_FILE_EXISTS</code>. <code>QMAKE_QUIET_CLEAN</code> is
    similar <code>QMAKE_CLEAN</code>, but adds
    <code>$(QMAKE_IF_FILE_EXISTS)</code> to the beginning of each
    <code>$(DEL_FILE)</code> statement to delete a file only if it exists (to
    avoid system warnings).</p>

    <p>11. Object files are no more forced to have the <kbd>.o</kbd>
    extension. The standard qmake <code>QMAKE_EXT_OBJ</code> variable is used
    instead (by default, on OS/2 it equals to <kbd>.obj</kbd>).
    <code>QMAKE_EXT_CPP</code> variable is regarded as well.</p>

    <p>12. Library files now have the <kbd>.lib</kbd> extension (instead of
    <kbd>.a</kbd>), and the <kbd>lib...</kbd> prefix is no more prepended.</p>

    <p>13. Added new <code>QMAKE_CFLAGS_INCDIR</code>,
    <code>QMAKE_LFLAGS_LIBDIR</code>, <code>QMAKE_LFLAGS_LIB</code> qmake
    variables to make it possible to customize the coorresponding flags (i.e.,
    <kbd>-I</kbd>, <kbd>-L</kbd> and <kbd>-l</kbd>, as for GCC) in the
    <kbd>.conf</kbd> file.</p>

    <p>14. Added new <code>QMAKE_LIBS_QT_DLL</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_LIBS_QT_THREAD_DLL</code> qmake variables to specify the list
    of libraries required when the application is linked against the DLL
    version of Qt, separately from the list of libraries required for linking
    against the static Qt library.</p>

    <p>15. The <code>QMAKESPECDIR</code> variable is defined in the generated
    makefile and points to the directory where a <kbd>qmake.conf</kbd> file
    being used was read from.</p>

    <p>16. Added new qmake variables <code>DEF_FILE_TEMPLATE</code> and
    <code>DEF_FILE_MAP</code>. When the target is the dynamic link library and
    <code>DEF_FILE</code> is <b>not</b> defined in the project file, these
    variables (when defined) go to the generated makefile w/o any changes.
    They are also appended (as GNU make variables) to the contents of the
    <code>QMAKE_GENDEF_DEPS</code> variable (see 6).
    <code>DEF_FILE_TEMPLATE</code> is intended to point to an existing
    template for a <kbd>.def</kbd> file. <code>DEF_FILE_MAP</code> should
    point to an existing file used to store ordinals assigned to exported
    symbols (to make assignments persistent from build to build). The backend
    itself doesn't use these variables, they are used only to pass the
    information from the project file to the generated makefile. It is the
    responsibility of the <kbd>.conf</kbd> file to implement the described
    functionality.</p>

    <p>17. Objects defining custom targets got the <code>.extradeps</code>
    attribute. This attrubute allows to specify additional target dependencies
    that are not followed by commands. That is, if you have the following
    extra target definition:</p>

    <pre>my_target.target = somefile
my_target.depends = anotherfile
my_target.extradeps = export SOMETHING = something
my_target.commands = coolcmd &gt; $$my_target.target</pre>

    <p>you'll get in the generated makefile:</p>

    <pre>somefile : export SOMETHING = something
somefile : anotherfile
    coolcmd &gt; somefile</pre>

    <p>Note that if you two or more additional dependencies each placed on a
    separate line, you can separate them using '<kbd>&nbsp;;;&nbsp;</kbd>' (a
    double semicolon surrounded by single spaces) in the definition of the
    <code>.extradeps</code> attribute.</p>

    <p>18. Besides the standard <code>INCPATH</code> make variable that
    defines a list of include directories for the C/C++ compiler (separated by
    spaces and usually prepended with a compiler switch), all generated
    makefiles contain the <code>INCLUDEPATH</code> make variable that defines
    the same list of directories but separated by semicolons (and therefore
    suitable for assigning to <kbd>PATH</kbd>-like environment variables).</p>

    <p>19. Added internal qmake variables <code>QMAKE_RUN_RC_RES</code> and
    <code>QMAKE_RUN_RC_EXE</code> necessary to implement the support for
    <code>RC_FILE</code> and <code>RES_FILE</code> project variables.
    <code>QMAKE_RUN_RC_RES</code> defines a command line to generate a project
    <kbd>.res</kbd> file from an <kbd>.rc</kbd> file specified in
    <code>RC_FILE</code>. It should use <code>$(RC_FILE)</code> as a source
    and <code>$(RES_FILE)</code> as a target of the operation. This command is
    used only when the <code>RC_FILE</code> project variable is not empty.
    <code>QMAKE_RUN_RC_EXE</code> defines a command line to bind a
    <kbd>.res</kbd> file to the project executable. It should use
    <code>$(RES_FILE)</code> to specify the <kbd>.res</kbd> file to bind and
    <code>$(TARGET)</code> to specify the executable file name.</p>

    <p>20. Added the internal qmake variable
    <code>QMAKE_LIBDIR_QT_DEBUG</code>. It defines where to place the Qt
    library when the debug version is being built, and also where to search
    for it when the project file of an application contains <kbd>qt</kbd> and
    <kbd>debug</kbd> keywords in the <code>CONFIG</code> statement.</p>

    <p>21. The <code>VERSION</code> project variable is copied by
    <kbd>qmake</kbd> (as is) to the generated makefile. Note that its value
    does not affect the name of the generated DLL target anymore (for projects
    with the <kbd>lib</kbd> template and with the <kbd>dll</kbd> keyword in
    <code>CONFIG</code>), as opposed to other qmake backends. Appending a
    version number to the DLL name could implicitly lead to running out of the
    8x3 naming limit that is still present in OS/2 for DLLs loaded by module
    name (the most common case). Instead, the <code>VERSION</code> macro can
    be used by qmake compiler specifications to embed the version to the
    generated DLL file itself (as the GCC specification does).</p>

    <p>22. Added the internal qmake variable <code>QMAKE_DEFINES_QT</code>. It
    is intended to list a set of C/C++ defines to be used during compilation
    of C/C++ sources when either <kbd>qt</kbd>, <kbd>qtinc</kbd> or
    <kbd>build_qt</kbd> is present in the <code>CONFIG</code> statement. Using
    this variable instead of <code>DEFINES</code> keeps non-Qt projects free
    from Qt-only related defines (otherwise added to every Makefile generated
    by <kbd>qmake</kbd> from any project file).</p>
