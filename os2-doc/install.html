    <title>Qt Toolkit Version 3 for OS/2</title>
  </head>

  <body id="install">
    <h1><a name="top">Installation</a></h1>

    <p>This section describes how to install, configure and build the Qt
    Toolkit under OS/2.</p>

    <h2><a name="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

    <p>In order to build the Qt Toolkit Version 3 under OS/2 or eComStation
    you need the following tools:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Compiler: <a
      href="http://www.innotek.de/products/gccos2/download/gccos2download_e.html">Innotek
      GCC 3.3.2 for OS/2 beta 4</a> updated to <a
      href="http://www.innotek.de/products/gccos2/download/gccos2download_e.html">CSD1</a>.<br />Download
      and install according to the installation instructions
      (<kbd>usr\doc\GCC-3.2.2\Install.os2</kbd>).</li>

      <li>Linker: IBM ILINK 3.08, a part of the IBM Visual Age C/C++ 3
      distribution updated to version 3.08.<br />You need only two files,
      <kbd>BIN\ILINK.EXE</kbd> and <kbd>DLL\CPPOM30.DLL</kbd>. If you already
      have IBM Visual Age C/C++ installed, you don't need to do anything else.
      Otherwise, copy the above two files to some directory.<br /><b>Note:</b>
      A separate distribution of IBM ILINK 5.0 available through the software
      subscription will not work, because it has some serious bugs related to
      exporting large amounts of symbols.</li>

      <li>Make utility: <a
      href="http://www.unixos2.org/sw/pub/binary/make/make-3_81beta1-bin-static.zip">GNU
      Make 3.81beta1</a>. Just unzip the file <kbd>make.exe</kbd> to some
      directory.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Check that the above tooks work, and then proceed to the following
    step.</p>

    <h2><a name="BuildingQt">Building Qt</a></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Unzip the contents of the Qt for OS/2 distribution archive to some
      directory.</li>

      <li>Go to that directory, run the <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd> script and
      follow on-screen instructions.<br />You will be prompted to enter
      directories where the script will search for the required tools and to
      configure the library type you want to build. Note that it is not
      necessary to remember a full path to a tool -- you can specify an
      upper-level directory or simply a root directory of the drive you have
      installed the tools onto.</li>

      <li>Wait until the compilation process is finished.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the compilation process fails, you can inspect the file
    <kbd>build.log</kbd> created in the installation directory.</p>

    <p>After the Qt library is successfully compiled and built, it is
    recommended that you place the <kbd>qt.cmd</kbd> script that was generated
    in the installation directory to some of the directories listed in your
    <kbd>PATH</kbd> environment variable and use it as a command line wrapper
    to work with the Qt Toolkit: run tutorials and examples, compile your own
    programs, etc. The script sets up the environment necessary for the Qt
    Toolkit and for all other tools and simply passes all command line
    arguments to the command line interpreter. For example, in order to run
    the last Qt tutorial application, go to the subdirectory
    <kbd>tutorial\t14</kbd> located inside the installation directory and
    execute the following command (provided that you have already placed
    <kbd>qt.cmd</kbd> somewhere in the <kbd>PATH</kbd>):</p>

    <pre>qt.cmd t14.exe</pre>

    <p>To recompile the tutorial you can type</p>

    <pre>qt.cmd make</pre>
