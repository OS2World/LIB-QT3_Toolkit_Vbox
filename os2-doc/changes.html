    <h2>Release Candidate 6 (2005-11-18) [<kbd>3.3.1-rc06</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>The project has been moved to the SVN repository on netlabs (<a
    href="http://svn.netlabs.org">svn.netlabs.org</a>). The direct path to the
    main development branch is <a
    href="http://svn.netlabs.org/repos/qt3/trunk">http://svn.netlabs.org/repos/qt3/trunk</a>.</p>

    <p>The file <kbd>src/tools/qconfig.cpp</kbd> (containing default
    installation paths) is now automatically generated by the
    <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd> script when configuring the Qt library.</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 5 (2005-11-12) [<kbd>rc05</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p><b>Important Note</b>. The Qt DLL built by this release is binary
    incompatible with the previous release. All applications must be relinked
    against the new version of the library.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p><code>QCursor</code> is fully implemented, including creating custom
    pointer shapes from bitmaps.</p>

    <p><code>QT_NO_PROPERTIES</code> macro is not defined any more, so
    <code>QObject</code>'s properties functionality is now available.</p>

    <p>Implemented OS/2 PM Clipboard support (<code>QMime</code> and
    <code>QClipboard</code> classes); <code>QT_NO_CLIPBOARD</code> macro is no
    more defined by default.</p>

    <p>Implemented <code>QPixmap::xForm()</code>;
    <code>QT_NO_PIXMAP_TRANSFORMATION</code> is no more defined by
    default.</p>

    <p>Implemented font transformations according to <code>QPainter</code>
    view and world matrices (this still has some issues because both native
    TTF and FreeType2 font rendering engines are bogus when applying complex
    world transformations such as rotation).</p>

    <p>Added the <code>QMovie</code> class; <code>QT_NO_MOVIE</code> is no
    more defined by default.</p>

    <p>Enabled translation (internationalization) services, including
    <code>QTranslator</code> and <code>QTranslatorMessage</code> classes, plus
    <kbd>lupdate.exe</kbd> and <kbd>lrelease.exe</kbd> command line tools.
    <code>QT_NO_TRANSLATION</code> is no more defined.</p>

    <h3>dialogs</h3>

    <p>OS/2 and eComStation are now mentioned in the
    <code>QMessageBox::aboutQt()</code> dialog.</p>

    <h3>workspace</h3>

    <p>Added the <kbd>workspace</kbd> module (<code>QWorkspace</code> class).
    The limitation of the current implementation is that child windows don't
    have sysmenu/min/max/close buttons and cannot be
    closed/maximized/minimized using the titlebar.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>New examples: <kbd>action</kbd>, <kbd>application</kbd>,
    <kbd>cursor</kbd>, <kbd>drawlines</kbd>, <kbd>i18n</kbd>, <kbd>mdi</kbd>,
    <kbd>network/archivesearch</kbd>, <kbd>network/ftpclient</kbd>,
    <kbd>network/infoprotocol</kbd>, <kbd>network/remotecontrol</kbd>,
    <kbd>picture</kbd>, <kbd>qfd</kbd>, <kbd>qmag</kbd>, <kbd>qtl</kbd>,
    <kbd>qwerty</kbd>, <kbd>rot13</kbd>, <kbd>showimg</kbd>,
    <kbd>textedit</kbd>, <kbd>tictac</kbd>, <kbd>toplevel</kbd> and
    <kbd>xform</kbd>.</p>

    <p>Various fixes (<code>QTextEdit</code> in <code>LogText</code> mode,
    <code>QPopupMenu</code> with multiple columns, using pixel sizes to select
    fonts), see <kbd>os2-doc\ChangeLog</kbd> for more info.</p>

    <p>Added two new qmake project variables to the <kbd>GNUMake</kbd>
    backend: <code>DEF_FILE_TEMPLATE</code> and <code>DEF_FILE_MAP</code> (see
    <a href="gnumake.html">here</a> for more info).
    <kbd>mkspecs/os2-g++/qmake.conf</kbd> recognizes these variables and (with
    the help of the supplied <kbd>emxexpw.cmd</kbd> script) uses them as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>If <code>DEF_FILE_TEMPLATE</code> is defined, it is expected to
      point to an existing <kbd>.def</kbd> file template used when creating a
      <kbd>.def</kbd> file for the DLL. In this template, all occurences of
      the <code>${name}</code> macro are replaced with the name of the DLL and
      the first occurence of the <code>${exports}</code> macro is replaced
      with the list of exported symbols. If <code>DEF_FILE_TEMPLATE</code> is
      not defined, the default template is used (<code>INITINSTANCE</code>
      <code>TERMINSTANCE</code>, <code>DATA</code> <code>MULTIPLE</code>
      <code>NONSHARED</code>).</li>

      <li>If <code>DEF_FILE_MAP</code> is defined, it must point to an
      existing file (it may be empty for the first time). Specifying a map
      file tells the <kbd>.def</kbd> file generator to export all public
      symbols by ordinals only (to reduce the DLL size and speed up access to
      exported symbols). This map file is used to store ordinals assigned to
      exported symbols (to guarantee these assignments are persistent from
      build to build, which in turn helps to support binary DLL
      compatibility). For more details about the format of the map file,
      please refer to the <kbd>envexpw.cmd</kbd> script. If
      <code>DEF_FILE_MAP</code> is not defined, all symbols are exported by
      name.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Qt library, when built as a DLL, makes usage of the above
    <code>DEF_FILE_*</code> variables. This makes it possible to maintain
    binary compatibility between newer and older releases whenever it is
    technically possible (i.e. no new data members in Qt classes etc.).</p>

    <p>The <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd> script has been rewritten from scratch. It
    is now fully interactive and is capable of searching for suitable versions
    of the compiler, linker and the make tool in the locations specified by
    the user.</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 4 (2004-10-02) [<kbd>rc04</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>This release contains few fixes (<kbd>\os2-doc\ChangeLog</kbd> for full
    list) as well as the following new functionality.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>Added zlib, jpeg, png, mng support (controlled via
    <kbd>\configure.cmd</kbd>), async I/O classes (defined in
    <kbd>asyncio.h</kbd>).</p>

    <p>Added basic MIME support (<code>QMimeSource</code> class), no PM DDE
    &lt;-&gt; open MIME conversion yet (<code>QMimeSource</code> is just
    necessary for some other classes). Added basic DND support
    (<code>QDragObject</code>, <code>QImageDrag</code>,
    <code>QTextDrag</code>, <code>QStoredDrag</code>, <code>QUriDrag</code>),
    but no real drag &amp; drop yet (<code>QT_NO_DRAGANDDROP</code> is still
    defined, but some classes need <code>QDragObject</code> and others to make
    the correct usage of <code>QMimeSource</code>).</p>

    <p><code>QRegion</code> now supports creating regions from
    <code>QBitmap</code>s (<code>QRegion(const QBitmap &amp;)</code>
    constructor).</p>

    <h3>widgets</h3>

    <p>New classes: <code>QWidgetPlugin</code> (necessary for some other new
    classes), <code>QTextBrowser</code>; <code>QDateTimeEditor</code>,
    <code>QDial</code>, <code>QSplashScreen</code>,
    <code>QWhatsThis</code>.</p>

    <p>Implemented animation effects support, (see
    <code>QApplicaition::setEffectEnabled()</code>,
    <code>isEffectEnabled()</code> methods), this means that the
    <kbd>widgets</kbd> module is now completely implemented.</p>

    <h3>network</h3>

    <p>Implemented network module (classes <code>QDns</code>,
    <code>QFtp</code>, <code>QHostAddress</code>, <code>QHttp</code>,
    <code>QServerSocket</code>, <code>QSocket</code>,
    <code>QSocketDevice</code>, <code>QSocketNotifier</code>) with the
    following limitations: no IPv6 support (<code>QT_NO_IPV6</code> is
    defined), no synchronous lookups (i.e. defining
    <code>Q_DNS_SYNCHRONOUS</code> in <kbd>qdns.h</kbd> is useless),
    <code>QSocketDevice::blocking()</code> always returns <code>TRUE</code>
    (it seems that there's no way to determine the current blocking state of
    an arbitrary socket).</p>

    <p>Note: the socket notification (<code>QSocketNotifier</code>)
    functionality is not available when Qt is compiled without threading
    support (this also means that <code>QDns</code> class will not function
    properly, as well as many other network applications that rely on the
    socket notification mechanism provided by Qt); in a single-threaded
    version of Qt such methods as
    <code>QEventLoop::registerSocketNotifier()</code> simply do nothing, and
    notification signals are never emitted.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>The <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd> script has been moved from the
    <kbd>\bin</kbd> subdirectory to the root directory of the project.</p>

    <p>Added new examples: <kbd>scrollview</kbd>, <kbd>helpviewer</kbd>;
    <kbd>network\clientserver</kbd>, <kbd>network\httpd</kbd>,
    <kbd>network\mail</kbd>, <kbd>network\networkprotocol</kbd>; all xml
    examples (the <kbd>xml</kbd> subdirectory). Note that the
    <kbd>helpviewer</kbd> example shows nothing after invocation (because Qt
    docs are not contained in the repository), point it to the existing html
    file to see the results.</p>

    <h4>GNUMake backend for qmake</h4>

    <p>A new makefile generator (backend) for qmake has been created,
    <kbd>GNUMAKE</kbd>. It is now used in Qt/OS2 along with the GCC compiler
    and the GNU Make utility to generate makefiles from <kbd>qmake</kbd>'s
    project files (instead of a bit buggy MINGWMAKE backend). See <a
    href="gnumake.html">here</a> for more information about the GNUMAKE
    backend.</p>

    <h4>new linker</h4>

    <p>The linker used along with the GCC compiler has been changed. The
    previously used IBM ILINK 5.0 has some very unpleasant bugs that do not
    allow to build the DLL version (see below) of the Qt library. It is now
    necessary to use the linker from the distribution of IBM Visual Age C/C++
    version 3.08. The copies of your <kbd>gcc322.cmd</kbd> and
    <kbd>qt.cmd</kbd> scripts should be updated with the new ones from the
    <kbd>\os2-misc</kbd> subdirectory (don't forget to correct path variables
    inside the scripts). Read also <a href="general.html#compilation">here
    </a>about the steps necessary to compile the Qt Library.</p>

    <p>Note that ILINK 3.08 creates executables and DLLs that are slightly
    bigger in size comparing to ones produced by ILINK 5.0. The freeware tool
    <a
    href="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-search?key=lxlite&amp;pushbutton=Search">lxlite</a>
    can be used to reduce the size of executables and DLLs, if desired.</p>

    <h4>DLL version of Qt</h4>

    <p>The Qt library can now be compiled as the DLL. The <code>DLL</code>
    variable has been added to the <kbd>\configure.cmd</kbd> script to control
    the type of the Qt library to compile. Set it to <kbd>1</kbd> to compile
    Qt as the the DLL and to <kbd>0</kbd> to compile it as the static library.
    After building the Qt DLL using <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd>, all Qt programs
    built using qmake wil be linked against this DLL. By default,
    <kbd>configure.cmd</kbd> compiles Qt as the release DLL with all available
    features turned on (excluding the <kbd>gif</kbd> support, due to its
    license limitations).</p>

    <h4>uic tool</h4>

    <p>The user interface compiler (<kbd>uic</kbd>) utility has been added to
    the project. As for now, It is primarily necessary to process the
    <code>IMAGES</code> qmake's project variable used to embed a collection of
    images to the executable, but can be also used to compile the user
    interface (<kbd>.ui</kbd>) files as well. However, there's still no
    QDesigner for OS/2, so <kbd>.ui</kbd> files can be created and edited only
    manually (with one limitation -- widget properties for setting the cursor
    shape are not supported by the current version of <kbd>uic</kbd> due to
    the currently incomplete <code>QCursor</code> class implementation).</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 3 (2004-06-23) [<kbd>rc03</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>This release contains some fixes (see <kbd>\os2-doc\ChangeLog</kbd>) as
    well as the following new functionality.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>Qt applications now use the PM Scheme Palette font settings to setup
    default fonts for widgets. This can be disabled by calling
    <code>QApplication::setDesktopSettingsAware(FALSE)</code>.</p>

    <h3>widgets</h3>

    <p>The <code>QWidget::reparent()</code> method has been implemented.
    Things like tear-off menus (see the <kbd>menu</kbd> example) and toolbars
    (the <kbd>action\toggleaction</kbd> example) seem to work well.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>New examples: <kbd>menu</kbd>, <kbd>rangecontrols</kbd>,
    <kbd>listbox</kbd>, <kbd>tabdialog</kbd>, <kbd>wizard</kbd>,
    <kbd>life</kbd>, <kbd>hello</kbd>, <kbd>gridview</kbd>,
    <kbd>forever</kbd>, <kbd>fonts</kbd>, <kbd>addressbook</kbd>,
    <kbd>splitter</kbd>, <kbd>layout</kbd>, <kbd>customlayout</kbd>,
    <kbd>themes</kbd>, <kbd>scribble</kbd>, <kbd>action\toggleaction</kbd>,
    <kbd>thread\prodcons</kbd>, <kbd>thread\semaphores</kbd>. Note that the
    <kbd>themes</kbd> example using the Norwegian Wood theme doesn't handle
    the button roundness because non-rectangular widgets are not currently
    supported by Qt/OS2.</p>

    <p>The <code>RELEASE</code> variable has been added to the
    <kbd>bin\configure.cmd</kbd> script to control the type of the Qt library
    to be compiled. Set it to <kbd>1</kbd> to compile the release version and
    to <kbd>0</kbd> to compile the debug version.</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 2 (2004-06-16) [<kbd>rc02</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>This release is mostly a bugfix. See <kbd>\os2-doc\ChangeLog</kbd> for
    the detailed info about all fixes applied. Also, the following
    functionality has been added.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>Qt applications now use the PM Scheme Palette color settings to setup
    the default palette for widgets. This can be disabled by calling
    <code>QApplication::setDesktopSettingsAware(FALSE)</code>.</p>

    <p>Mouse wheel handling (<code>QEvent::Wheel</code>) now works, the wheel
    can be used in all widgets that support it. System settings for the mouse
    wheel (standard or AMouse) are currently ignored, because Qt handles
    things such as the number of lines to scroll per whell rotation on its
    own, and doesn't offer a setting to tell it to be aware of system
    settings.</p>

    <p>The optimization setting for pixmaps with masks is now meaningful:
    <code>NoOptim</code>/<code>MemoryOptim</code> optimizes for memory,
    <code>NormalOptim</code>/<code>BestOptim</code> -- for speed. Memory
    optimization causes QPixmap not to store a special precomposed image for
    every pixmap but recreate it every time the pixmap is drawn.</p>

    <p>Rich text support for widgets has been enabled and seems to work well.
    This includes <code>QStyleSheet</code> and <code>QSimpleRichText</code>
    classes. Widgets that support it (for example, QMessageBox) now display
    rich text strings correctly.</p>

    <h3>widgets</h3>

    <p>New widgets: <code>QGridView</code>, <code>QSpinBox</code>,
    <code>QSyntaxHighlighter</code>, <code>QTextEdit</code>,
    <code>QTextView</code>.</p>

    <h3>dialogs</h3>

    <p>Two new dialogs: <code>QColorDialog</code> and
    <code>QFontDialog</code>.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>New examples: <kbd>lineedits</kbd>, <kbd>listboxcombo</kbd>,
    <kbd>listviews</kbd>, <kbd>progressbar</kbd>.</p>

    <h2>Release Candidate 1 (2004-06-04) [<kbd>rc01</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>This release candidate brings Qt/OS2 functioality to a level where it
    can be used to create simipe "general-purpose" applications: many commonly
    used widgets are done. Some (mostly cosmetic) shortcomings are still
    present (for example, images do not support transparency yet) -- this will
    be fixed in next releases.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>The modal widget functionality has been implemented (including
    <code>Qt::WShowModal</code> widget flag).
    <code>QEvent::WindowBlocked</code> and <code>WindowUnblocked</code> are
    now sent to widgets when they are blocked/unblocked by modal widgets.
    Unlike on Qt/Win32, these events are sent to all top-level widgets, not
    only to the direct parent of the modal widget being shown/hidden.</p>

    <p>The popup widget functionality has been done
    (<code>Qt::WType_Popup</code> widget flag). It has no significant
    differences comparing to Qt/Win32; in particular, popup widgets do not
    grab mouse move events addressed to widgets from other applications,
    except when a mouse button is pressed down while moving (as this can be
    seen in the <kbd>popup</kbd> example). It should be noted here, that
    <code>QWidget::grabMouse()</code> in OS/2 does grab such events, which
    differs from Qt/Win32 where this function has the same effect as in
    popups.</p>

    <p>New classes: <code>QLocalFs</code>, <code>QUrl</code>,
    <code>QUrlOperator</code>, <code>QUrlInfo</code>,
    <code>QNetworkProtocol</code>. These classes do not bring the network
    support to Qt/OS2 -- they are network helper classes that also required by
    some common widgets, such as <code>QFileDialog</code>.</p>

    <h3>dialogs</h3>

    <p>The dialogs module has been started: <code>QDialog</code>,
    <code>QMessageBox</code>, <code>QProgressDialog</code> and
    <code>QFileDialog</code> are now present. <code>QFileDialog</code> is a
    pure Qt widget, native OS/2 PM file dialogs are not yet supported.</p>

    <h3>widgets</h3>

    <p>New widgets:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>QPopupMenu</code> and <code>QMenuBar</code> (including
      <code>QMenuData</code>);</li>

      <li><code>QLineEdit</code>, <code>QValidator</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QProgressBar</code>, <code>QStatusBar</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QMainWindow</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QComboBox</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QDockArea</code>, <code>QDockWindow</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QListBox</code>, <code>QListView</code>,
      <code>QHeader</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QScrollBar</code>, <code>QScrollView</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QSplitter</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QTitleBar</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QToolBar</code>; <code>QToolButton</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QToolTip</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QWidgetStack</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>New methods:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>QApplication::cursorFlashTime()</code> and
      <code>setCursorFlashTime()</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QApplication::doubleClickInterval()</code> and
      <code>setDoubleClickInterval()</code>;</li>

      <li><code>QWidget::scroll()</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>New examples: <kbd>popup</kbd>, <kbd>progress</kbd>,
    <kbd>buttongroups</kbd>, <kbd>checklists</kbd>, <kbd>tooltip</kbd>.</p>

    <h2>Beta 2 (2004-05-27) [<kbd>b02</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>Mouse and keyboard event handling has been implemented. The following
    new types of events are now handled by Qt/OS2 and delivered to
    widgets:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>mouse events (<code>QEvent::MouseButtonPress</code>,
      <code>MouseButtonRelease</code>, <code>MouseButtonDblClick</code>,
      <code>MouseMove</code>);</li>

      <li>mouse enter/leave events (<code>QEvent::Enter</code>,
      <code>Leave</code>);</li>

      <li>show/hide/close events (<code>QEvent::Show</code>,
      <code>Hide</code>, <code>Close</code>);</li>

      <li>focus events (<code>QEvent::FocusIn</code>,
      <code>FocusOut</code>);</li>

      <li>window activation change events
      (<code>QEvent::WindowActivate</code>,
      <code>WindowDeactivate</code>);</li>

      <li>context menu event (<code>QEvent::ContextMenu</code>);</li>

      <li>keyboard events (<code>QEvent::keyPress</code>,
      <code>keyRelease</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, the following has been added:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>QApplication</code>:
      <code>setGlobalMouseTracking()</code>.</li>

      <li><code>QWidget</code>:<ul>
          <li><code>mapToGlobal()</code>, <code>mapFromGlobal()</code>.</li>

          <li><code>setMinimumSize()</code> and <code>setMaximumSize()</code>
          now make sense (although system recommended minimum top-level window
          size is still obeyed, for compatibility with Qt/Win32).</li>
        </ul></li>

      <li><code>QPainter</code>: <code>drawRoundRect()</code>,
      <code>drawCubicBezier()</code>. All <code>QPainter</code> methods are
      now implemented.</li>

      <li><code>QAccel</code> and <code>QKeySequence</code> classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Keyboard handling</h4>

    <p>DBCS keyboard input is not tested, and most likely will not work
    correctly in Qt/OS2.</p>

    <h4>System menu</h4>

    <p>The system menu of the top-level widget (if it is present) can be
    activated by pressing the <kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;space&gt;</kbd> keyboard
    combination. Pressing single <kbd>ALT</kbd> doesn't show it, this is done
    for compatibility with other Qt versions. Also, frame size/position
    accelerators (<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd> etc.) have been disabled for
    the same reason. They are still present in the menu item text, but it will
    be fixed in the next release.</p>

    <h3>widgets</h3>

    <p>The <kbd>widgets</kbd> module implementation has been started. The
    following classes are currently available and seem to function well:
    <code>QButton</code>, <code>QButtonGroup</code>, <code>QLabel</code>,
    <code>QFrame</code>, <code>QPushButton</code>, <code>QCheckButton</code>,
    <code>QRadioButton</code>, <code>QLCDNumber</code>, QRangeControl,
    <code>QSlider</code>.</p>

    <p>Also, layout management has been completely compiled in and partially
    tested, including classes: <code>QBoxLayout</code>,
    <code>QButtonGroup</code>, <code>QGLayoutIterator</code>,
    <code>QGrid</code>, <code>QGridLayout</code>, <code>QGroupBox</code>,
    <code>QHBox</code>, <code>QHBoxLayout</code>, <code>QHButtonGroup</code>,
    <code>QHGroupBox</code>, <code>QLayout</code>, <code>QLayoutItem</code>,
    <code>QLayoutIterator</code>, <code>QSizePolicy</code>,
    <code>QSpacerItem</code>, <code>QVBox</code>, <code>QVBoxLayout</code>,
    <code>QVButtonGroup</code>, <code>QVGroupBox</code>,
    <code>QWidgetItem</code>.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>The Qt/OS2 distribution now contains the Qt tutorial and examples from
    the original Qt 3.3.1 distribution that can be compiled without any
    modifications and run well under OS/2. This doesn't mean though that they
    are fully functional (comparing to other platforms) -- some functionality
    (such as the non-rectangular window in the aclock example) is still
    missing in Qt/OS2, but these examples can at least properly handle such
    situations (usually doing nothing or keeping some kind of "default"
    behavior when the missing functionality is requested).</p>

    <p>The Qt tutorial can be completely compiled on OS/2 and works fine, as
    well as <kbd>aclock</kbd> and <kbd>dclock</kbd> examples. The compilation

    <h2>Beta 1 (2004-05-18) [<kbd>b01</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>Big work is done to implement the font support (<code>QFont</code>,
    <code>QFontInfo</code>, <code>QFontMetrics</code>,
    <code>QFontDatabase</code> classes). This in particular means that all
    kernel module visualization functionality (primitives, images, fonts) is
    now done. The current font implementation has the following
    limitations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DBCS fonts will most likely not work correctly (a serious work is
      required to support such scripts as arabic, herbew, japanese), so true
      unicode is not fully supported. Also this means that it's not possible
      to draw glyphs from different scripts at the same time, only glyphs from
      the current character set (usually system default) are available to
      draw, <code>QFont::Script</code> values are totally ignored.</li>

      <li>Foundries in family names are ignored (the same behavior is on
      Qt/Win32).</li>

      <li>Printer output is not yet supported (this also relates to all other
      kernel parts).</li>

      <li><code>QFontMetrics</code>: <code>minRightBearing()</code> and
      <code>minLeftBearing()</code> return zero at the present.</li>

      <li>Text drawing and font measuring operations are not subject of any
      coordinate space transformations except the simple translation
      transformation.</li>

      <li>No font style simulation (bold and italic) is done, only true styles
      of the fonts installed in the system are available.</li>

      <li><code>QFontDatabase</code>: due to a bug in
      <code>GpiQueryFontAction()</code> API the Qt font database is not
      sensible to font changes (installing/removing fonts from the system)
      during the application lifetime. This means that the application should
      be restarted in order to pick up such changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, the following has been added:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>QPainter</code>: <code>drawText()</code> (+ font getter/setter
      methods), <code>drawEllipse()</code>, <code>drawArc()</code>,
      <code>drawPie()</code>, <code>drawChord()</code>,
      <code>drawPolyLine()</code>, <code>drawLineSegments()</code>,
      <code>drawWinFocusRect()</code>.</li>

      <li><code>QWidget</code>: <code>drawText()</code> (+ font getter/setter
      methods).</li>

      <li><code>QIconSet</code> and <code>QPicture</code> are now
      available.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>styles</h3>

    <p>The styles module (<code>QStyle</code>, <code>QStyleFactory</code>
    etc.) has been enabled for compilation. Currently, OS/2 version of Qt uses
    the "Windows" (<code>QWindowsStyle</code>) style for widgets by default
    (though, this cannot be seen in this beta -- no widgets that use styles
    are completely ready at this moment).</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The CVS repository changelog has been added to the distribution (it
      can be found in the <kbd>\os2-doc</kbd> directory). This changelog
      contains more detailed project change history.</li>

      <li>The link to GNU Make (<a href="general.html#compilation">here</a>)
      is now updated to refer to the latest version (it was outdated in
      <kbd>a02</kbd>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Alpha 2 (2004-05-07) [<kbd>a02</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>This alpha is intended to test the basic GUI functionality: widget
    creation, starting the main event loop, painting widgets and drawing on
    pixmaps (graphic primitives, colors, images).</p>

    <h3>tools</h3>

    <p>The <kbd>tools</kbd> module is completely done (some of recent classes
    are <code>QMutex</code>, <code>QSemaphore</code>,
    <code>QWaitCondition</code>, <code>QThread</code>,
    <code>QThreadStorage</code>).</p>

    <h4>QThread::wait (time)</h4>

    <p>Since OS/2 doesn't support specifying a maximum time to wait for a
    thread to end other than infininty we use a loop containing of wait
    intervals until the thread has ended or the maximum time specified by the
    caller has expired, which brings the granularity of 1 second (the length
    of the wait interval) to this process.</p>

    <h3>codecs</h3>

    <p>The <kbd>codecs</kbd> module (<code>QTextCodec</code> class) seems to
    be done (excluding <code>QHerbewCodec</code>, that depends on
    <code>QTextEngine</code>)</p>

    <h3>moc</h3>

    <p>The meta object compiler (<kbd>moc</kbd>) added to the project,
    compiled and seems to work well.</p>

    <h3>kernel</h3>

    <p>The <kbd>kernel</kbd> module is done on about 75 percent. Here are the
    most imortant classes that have been implemented (with a very brief
    description of implemented and disabled features -- the most of this will
    be changed later):</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>QApplication</code>: no handling of fonts (<code>QFont</code>
      and stuff), sessions, clipboard (<code>QClipboard</code>), drag&amp;drop
      and styles (<code>QStyle</code>) yet, event handling is still limited
      (only <code>QPaintEvent</code>, <code>QResizeEvent</code> and
      <code>QMoveEvent</code> plus some others).</li>

      <li><code>QEventLoop</code>: no <code>QSocketNotifier</code>
      functionality, no simple timers for plugins (that do not require the
      message queue)</li>

      <li><code>QPaintDevice</code>: no alpha blending, no printer
      (<code>QPrinter</code>) support</li>

      <li><code>QPaintDeviceMetrics</code></li>

      <li><code>QColor</code> (fully, including the palette support)</li>

      <li><code>QPixmap</code>: alpha pixmaps, no pixmap transformations
      (xForm())</li>

      <li><code>QBitmap</code></li>

      <li><code>QImage</code></li>

      <li><code>QRegion</code> (no y coordinate flipping yet, regions from
      ellipses and polygons are created as bounding rectangle regions, no
      regions from bitmaps, ready for limited usage only)</li>

      <li><code>QPainter</code>: everything related to fonts, text drawing and
      rich text classes is currently disabled</li>

      <li><code>QBrush</code>, <code>QPen</code></li>

      <li><code>QWidget</code>: everything related to fonts and cursors is
      currently disabled; no mask support (<code>setMask()</code>); no icon
      support (<code>setIcon()</code>); only few events at the moment
      (<code>paintEvent()</code>, <code>resizeEvent()</code>,
      <code>moveEvent()</code>)</li>

      <li><code>QDesktopWidget</code></li>

      <li><code>QLayout</code> and stuff</li>

      <li><code>QTimer</code></li>

      <li><code>QPalette</code></li>

      <li><code>QVariant</code> (<code>QFont</code>, <code>QIconSet</code> and
      <code>QKeySequense</code> are not yet handled)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is no support for MNG, PNG and JPEG formats at the moment, it
    will be compiled in later.</p>

    <p>There is no zlib integration yet, will also be done later.</p>

    <h3>other changes</h3>

    <p>Compilation tools are updated (Innotek GCC and GNU Make). The process
    of building Qt is changed (in particular, it is now built as the static
    library). This is described <a
    href="general.html#compilation">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The <kbd>aclock</kbd> example from the Qt-Win32 distribution now
    compiles and runs well (except that there is no full mouse support and no
    transparent mode). Instructions are at the same place as above.</p>

    <h2>Alpha 1 (2004-04-09) [<kbd>a01</kbd>]</h2>

    <hr />

    <p>The aim of this first step is to organize and test the compilation
    environment to make sure it is suitable for further development. Also it
    gives us many of non-visual widely used Qt classes from the
    <kbd>tools</kbd> module compiled for OS/2 as well as the OS/2 version of
    the <kbd>qmake</kbd> utility which uses these classes.</p>

    <p>Currently the following most important public Qt classes are available
    (this list is not complete): <code>QLibrary</code>,
    <code>QSettings</code>, <code>QDir</code>, <code>QFile</code>,
    <code>QFileInfo</code>, <code>QLocale</code> <code>QDate</code>,
    <code>QTime</code>, <code>QDateTime</code>, <code>QString</code>,
    <code>QChar</code>, <code>QCString</code> plus various container and
    iterator classes.</p>

    <h4>QSettings</h4>

    <p><code>QSettings</code> class is implemented using the Open32 registry
    API available in recent OS/2 versions (REGISTRY.DLL). This registry is
    very similar to the Windows one so this class should behave nearly the
    same as on Windows.</p>

    <h4>QFileInfo</h4>

    <p>The <code>QFileInfo</code> class is implemented in the following
    way:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code>isSymLink()</code> always returns <code>FALSE</code></li>

      <li><code>readLink()</code> always returns
      <code>QString::null</code></li>

      <li><code>owner()</code> = <code>group()</code> =
      <code>QString:null</code></li>

      <li><code>ownerID()</code> = <code>groupID()</code> =
      <code>-2</code></li>

      <li><code>permission()</code> always returns <code>TRUE</code> except
      the situation when the <code>permissionSpec</code> argument is
      <code>Write*</code> and the file is read-only</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>QString</h4>

    <p>Since everything is currently compiled with the
    <code>QT_NO_TEXTCODEC</code> flag set <code>QString</code> will return
    question (<kbd>?</kbd>) marks for all unicode symbos with codes greater
    than <code>0x00FF</code>. However, non-Unicode string data taken from the
    OS (for example in file operations) will be simply converted to unicode by
    expanding every non-unicode byte to a unicode word, meaning that the
    conversion from Unicode back to single byte (for example, during the
    output to the console) will preserve nationals. This is the standard
    behavior of Qt and it is not critical for most console mode applications
    as long as <code>QString</code>s are not presistently stored in the
    unicode form and the system local character set is not changed.</p>

    <h4>qmake</h4>

    <p>The current OS/2 version of qmake uses the MINGW makefile generator
    mode. Resulting makefiles produced by <kbd>qmake</kbd> from Qt project
    files seem to be processed well by GNU Make, however the following known
    limitations currently apply:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>object files are always created with the <kbd>.o</kbd> extension
      (although they are actually OMF files).</li>

      <li>dll files cannot be correctly linked without manual correction of
      the makefile because MINGW generator always adds the hard-encoded option
      <kbd>-Wl,--out-implib,libXXX.a</kbd> to a call to the linker to tell it
      to generate the import library, but this option is not compatible with
      Innotek GCC.</li>

      <li>MINGW generator assigns a dot to OBJECTS_DIR and MOC_DIR when they
      are not specified which causes GNU Make to produce warning
      messages.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These limitations will be eliminated in the future, probably by
    implementing a separate makefile generator class.</p>

    <p>qmake for OS/2 understands the new command line option <kbd>-os2</kbd>
    that tells it to use OS/2 semantics when generating makefiles, and the new
    scope specifier <kbd>os2</kbd> in Qt project files to isolate
    OS/2-specific project parts.</p>

    <p>The qmake specification for OS/2 and GCC is named <kbd>os2-g++</kbd>
    and after setting the <kbd>QMAKESPEC</kbd> variable accordingly it is
    available for use.</p>

    <p>Please also refer <a href="general.html#compilation">here</a> to get
    info about how to compile and run qmake.</p>
